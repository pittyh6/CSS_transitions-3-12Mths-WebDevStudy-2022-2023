# Web Developer Study
## 12 months web developer study. I decided to dedicate at least 12 months to learn web development.

* Online courses, challenges and creation of my own projects.

## What I learned/used 
### CSS 
* Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
    * transition
        * The property that we want to transition & The duration of the transition.
            * transition-property: background-color/color;
                * Color values, like color and background-color, will blend to a new color.
                * Length values like font-size, width, and height will grow or shrink.
            * transition-duration: 2s;
                * Duration is specified in seconds or milliseconds, such as 3s, 0.75s, 500ms.
            * transition-timing-function
                * ease-in — starts slow, accelerates quickly, stops abruptly
                * ease-out — begins abruptly, slows down, and ends slowly
                * ease-in-out — starts slow, gets fast in the middle, and ends slowly
                * linear — constant speed throughout
            * transition-delay.
                * transition-delay: 250ms;
            * Shorthand
                * Because these four properties (transition-property, transition-duration,transition-timing-function,  transition-delay ) are so frequently declared together, CSS provides a property that can be used to declare them all in one line: transition. This shorthand property describes each aspect of the transition puzzle in a single declaration. The properties must be specified in this order: transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, transition-delay.
                    * transition: color 1.5s linear 0.5s;
