* Online courses, challenges and creation of my own projects.

## What I learned/used 
### CSS 
* Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
    * transition
        * The property that we want to transition & The duration of the transition.
            * transition-property: background-color/color;
                * Color values, like color and background-color, will blend to a new color.
                * Length values like font-size, width, and height will grow or shrink.
            * transition-duration: 2s;
                * Duration is specified in seconds or milliseconds, such as 3s, 0.75s, 500ms.
